1. About this file
------------------

 This file should help you installing XS. For general information or configuration help, please 
 refer to the respective files.



2. Installation of ExtendedStats
--------------------------------

 2.1. Pereparation and dependencies

  XS has no dependencies except the standard ES libraries. However Linux users should read 3.1.
  Despite the the fact that there are no dependencies, using ExtendedEvents is highly recommended,
  especially for Day of Defeat Source users.
  If you upgrade XS from an older version it is highly recommended to make a backup of the database
  and the configuration files.
  
 2.2. Installation
 
  First of all you should edit staticConfiguration.py and extendedstats.cfg (see configuration.txt)
  to your needs.
  Then copy all files into the root folder of your server, preserving the folder structure.
  Put es_load extendedstats into the autoexec.cfg (if you are using gungame, extendedevents or
  other addons make sure extendedstats is after those load commands!).
  Restart your server.
  
  
  
3. Known Issues
---------------

 Although I try to fix all known issues before release, there are still two left which I either
 can't fix or which have no priority.
 
 3.1. Sqlite3
 
  As this addon uses Sqlite3 for data storage the Known Issues of ES apply. See the wiki page for
  more information: http://www.eventscripts.com/pages/Known_Issues#sqlite3
  
 3.2. Gungame Sourcemod
 
  The Sourcemod version of Gungame isn't detected on Day of Defeat Source.
